# Ace Your Next Coding Interview by Learning Algorithms through Programming and Puzzle Solving

## Learning Goals
### Learn essential algorithmic techniques
Greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and many other algorithmic approaches.

### Practice writing efficient and reliable code
Implement many algorithmic programming challenges in a programming language of choice: C++, Java, Python, C, C#, Haskell, Javascript, Kotlin, Ruby, Rust, and Scala. Invested thousands of hours into designing programming challenges and puzzles. The mantra is "Learning Algorithms Through Programming and Puzzle Solving" rather than the "Learning Algorithms by Answering Multiple Choice Questions" approach often used in MOOCs.

### Prepare for a coding interview
No other online course in Algorithms focuses on programming challenges that can be encountered at coding interviews.
